# What is OpenPanel and why should I care?

In the landscape of website hosting, standard hosting panels and shared hosting environments often come with their set of limitations and challenges. For instance, in a typical shared hosting scenario, users might face issues such as limited resources due to the shared nature of the environment, leading to potential performance degradation if other users on the same server consume excessive resources. Additionally, standard hosting panels often lack flexibility, offering users a rigid environment that may not fully meet their specific needs or allow for easy customization.

Security is another area where traditional shared hosting and standard panels fall short. Since multiple users share the same server resources, there's an inherent risk of cross-site contamination, where if one account gets compromised, it could potentially affect others. Moreover, standard hosting panels sometimes do not offer advanced security features or fine-grained control over user permissions, putting your web applications at risk.

This is where **[OpenPanel](https://openpanel.co/)** differentiates itself as a superior alternative. One of the key advantages of OpenPanel is its built-in user isolation feature. This critical security measure ensures that each user operates in a separate environment, significantly reducing the risk of cross-contamination between accounts on the same server. Such isolation is vital for maintaining the integrity and security of your web applications.

Furthermore, OpenPanel offers unparalleled flexibility compared to standard hosting panels. It allows users to customize their hosting environment to their exact specifications, accommodating unique requirements that traditional panels might not be able to meet. Whether it's installing specific software packages, configuring server settings, or managing security protocols, OpenPanel gives users the freedom to tailor their environment to their liking, without the constraints typically found in shared hosting or with standard panels.

In essence, OpenPanel stands out by providing a more secure, flexible, and user-friendly hosting solution. Its emphasis on user isolation ensures a safer hosting environment, while its adaptability allows users to create a hosting setup that perfectly aligns with their needs, setting a new standard in the web hosting industry.
