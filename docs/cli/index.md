# OpenCLI
OpenPanel uses OpenCLI, a command line interface designed for administrators to manage server from the terminal.

## Understanding OpenCLI

Upon installing OpenPanel, the system generates the executable file `/usr/bin/local/opencli`. This file will make all commands from `/usr/local/admin/scripts/` available.


## Autocomplete

The autocomplete functionality enhances user experience by displaying available OpenCLI commands. This feature is activated when you type the `opencli` command, add a space, and then press `TAB`. The command suggestions are dynamically generated by the `opencli commands` script, which compiles a list of commands into the `/usr/local/admin/scripts/commands.txt` file, utilized for the autocomplete suggestions.


## Available Commands

OpenCLI is comprised of over 100 separate scripts, collectively offering more than 140 terminal commands.
