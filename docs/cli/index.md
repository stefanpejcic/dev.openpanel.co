# OpenCLI
OpenPanel leverages OpenCLI, a robust tool powered by multiple Python scripts, designed to facilitate administrators in performing maintenance tasks and automating processes within the terminal environment.

## Understanding OpenCLI's Functionality

Upon installing OpenPanel, the system generates the executable file `/usr/bin/local/opencli`. This file is dedicated to executing the Python script located at `/usr/local/admin/scripts/opencli.py`, forwarding any command-line arguments received to it.

For instance, executing the command `opencli user-list` triggers the following process:

The executable `/usr/bin/local/opencli` activates the script `/usr/local/admin/scripts/opencli.py`, passing along the 'user-list' arguments.
The `opencli.py` script then identifies 'user' as the directory to search for the list.py file. It subsequently imports the main function from `/usr/local/admin/scripts/user/list.py` into the `opencli.py` script for execution.

## Autocomplete Feature in OpenCLI

The autocomplete functionality enhances user experience by displaying available OpenCLI commands. This feature is activated when you type the `opencli` command, add a space, and then press `TAB`. The command suggestions are dynamically generated by the `opencli commands` script, which compiles a list of commands into the `/usr/local/admin/scripts/commands.txt` file, utilized for the autocomplete suggestions.
